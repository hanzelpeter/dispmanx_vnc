dispmanx_vnc
============

VNC Server for Raspberry PI using dispmanx

compile with ./makeit or use make

you need to have installed libvncserver-dev and rbp-userland-dev-osmc

If you want to use X, modprobe evdev first.
Use -r for relative mode
Use -a for absolute mode
Without arguments it uses absolute mode for mouse

Relative mode makes hello_triangle2 to work. And also mouse moving in minecraft is better.
Still the mouse is tricky.
