dispmanx_vnc
============

VNC Server for Raspberry PI using dispmanx

Build with "make"

Building requires that the following is installed: libvncserver-dev, libconfig++-dev and g++ 4.7 or newer. 

Features
--------
- Practically no CPU usage when a VNC client is not connected. No need to stop when not in use.
- Runs well as a service
- Stable even when changing resolution
- Password support
- Configurable port number
- Configurable target frame rate, with automatic frame rate reduction down to 2/second when no updates are detected.
- Adaptable algorithm for the best performance both for update intensive applications like video and animations, and low CPU usage for updates to smaller regions of the screen
- Supports efficient downscaling to a quarter of the resoltion on the server side. Saves CPU, bandwidth and is practical for remote control of e.g. Kodi in high resolution from a computer with lower resolution

On raspbian wheezy, prepare using the following steps
-----------------------------------------------------

	sudo apt-get install g++-4.8 libvncserver-dev libconfig++-dev

Followed by 

	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.6 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.6 
	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 40 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 

And finally select the version you want to use with the following command

	sudo update-alternatives --config gcc

...or simply build with

	make CXX=g++-4.8

On raspbian jessie, prepare using the following
-----------------------------------------------
	sudo apt-get install g++ libvncserver-dev libconfig++-dev

On OSMC, prepare using the following
------------------------------------
	sudo apt-get install build-essential rbp-userland-dev-osmc libvncserver-dev libconfig++-dev

If the keyboard or mouse does not work
--------------------------------------
Make sure the appropriate driver is loaded by issuing

	sudo modprobe evdev

Make this load automatically at boot by adding the following on a separate row in /etc/modules

	evdev

After build
-----------
Run the program by issuing

	sudo ./dispmanx_vncserver
	
Parameters
	Usage: ./dispmanx_vncserver [OPTION]...

	-a, --absolute               absolute mouse movements
	-c, --config-file=FILE       use the specified configuration file
	-d, --downscale              downscales the screen to a quarter in vnc
	-f, --fullscreen             always runs fullscreen mode
	-m, --multi-threaded         runs vnc in a separate thread
	-p, --port=PORT              makes vnc available on the speficied port
	-P, --password=PASSWORD      protects the session with PASSWORD
	-r, --relative               relative mouse movements
	-s, --screen=SCREEN          opens the specified screen number
	-t, --frame-rate=RATE        sets the target frame rate, default is 15
	-u, --unsafe                 disables more robust handling of resolution
	                             change at a small performance gain
	    --help                   displays this help and exit

Config file
-----------
The program supports reading all the settings from a configuration file. See the attached .conf.sample-file. The default name of the config file is the same as of the binary with the extension ".conf". The program will first look in the same folder as the binary is placed, if not found there it will try /etc/. The configuration file name and location may be specified with the --config-file command line parameter. Any command line arguments will override those of the config file.

Relative mode makes hello_triangle2 to work. And also mouse moving in minecraft is better.
Still the mouse is tricky.
